# Totally Original Group Application
#### (The backend server part)

Serves the JSON data for the Group android application to consume.

## Using the API
Please [see the documentation page](https://assemblegroup.github.io/original-group-app-server/).

## Under the hood
This backend is written in PHP. It uses the following components:
- Micro-framework, [Slim](www.slimframework.com)
- ORM, [Propel](http://propelorm.org/)

If you want to commit, you need basic knowledge of both, and perhaps an idea of how the MVC pattern works too.
