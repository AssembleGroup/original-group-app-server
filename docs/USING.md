### End Points
The final column shows whether or not this route has been implemented (to at least a partially working degree) as of the latest commit. The parameter list should indicate how much is working.

Where necessary, pagination must be added (or put another way, would have to be added in a real system).

As stated, everything is returned in JSON format.

#####As of v0.2, all parameters are LOWER CASE to fit JSON de facto standards.
